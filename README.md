Description: This repository houses my Full Stack Development e-portfolio. There will be many commits to this repo as this portfolio is WIP. Over the next few months(Nov-May), many new and exciting projects and announcements will be added to this page. As my skills as a developer evolve, this page will improve in both appearance and functionality.

Purpose: This e-portfolio is meant to act as a catalogue of both my skills and aspirations as a Full Stack Developer. My main goal for this portfolio is for it to replace my current resume, allowing prospective employers/collaborators an opportunity to learn more about me in a concise format.
